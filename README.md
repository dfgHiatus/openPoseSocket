## FOR DEVELOPERS, READ ON

Included is the source code used to drive the fucntionality of this project, credit to @quanhua92 for the base model. You can build your own version with [pyinstaller --onefile -w '"FILENAME".py'].

### PREREQUISITES AND SETUP

- Have a web camera plugged in and make sure it's the default device.
- Install Python 3.8.6. If you already have python installed, you may need to upgrade/downgrade. Be sure to add python to PATH to run those batch files, since it uses pip directly.
